# Catalyst Model

> **The Catalyst is the optimization**

## ðŸŒŒ Constellation Information

- **Module Key**: `catalyst_model`  
- **Repository**: `catalyst-model`
- **Orbit**: ðŸ“ˆ
- **Status**: ðŸŒ¿
- **Emoji**: âš¡

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Review seeds/**: Adapt seeded data for this module
2. **Configure schemas/**: Update schema definitions as needed  
3. **Generate signals/**: Create latest.json broadcast file

## ðŸ“¡ Broadcasting

This module produces a `signals/latest.json` file conforming to the constellation's broadcast schema. The Signal (ðŸ“¡) aggregates these across all stars.  Use the shell script new-broadcast.sh to generate new signals.

## ðŸ”— CORE SYSTEM Links

- **Hub**: [FourTwenty Analytics](https://github.com/zbreeden/FourTwentyAnalytics)
- **The Archive**: Glossary, tags, and canonical definitions pulled down nightly and distributed out for constellation harmony.
- **The Signal**: Cross-constellation broadcasting and telemetry pulled and circulated nightly to foster promotion and development.
- **The Launch**: Detailed workflows pulled in nightly to assure an aligned culture of process improvement that starts from the Barycenter outwards to foster healthy architecture.
- **The Protector**: Examines workflows to assure drift is minimal fostering sustainability.
- **The Develper**: Feeds the constellation data for healthy modelling.

## Scripts

- FourTwentyGenesis.dib â€” Executable polyglot notebook (see `scripts/README_genesis.md`) that orchestrates genesis tasks: reset/scaffold, seed distribution, schema validation, and broadcast generation.
- `new-broadcast.sh` â€” Interactive shell helper that prompts for broadcast details and writes `signals/latest.json` (archives prior broadcasts to `signals/archive.latest.json`).
- `new-module.sh` â€” Canonical module scaffold script; creates a module folder with starter `README.md`, seeds, schema placeholders, and an initial `signals/latest.json`.

## Workflows

- Genesis Machine â€” The end-to-end orchestration described in `scripts/README_genesis.md` (run to reproduce the constellation genesis and validation pipeline).
- Capstone (Gravity Index) â€” Project plan and methodology for the Gravity Index capstone (`data/internal/capstone.md`): research questions, data sources, and deliverables.
- Eco Modeling â€” Data-source exploration and modeling notes (`data/internal/eco_modeling.md`) supporting the Gravity Index and other spatial analyses.
