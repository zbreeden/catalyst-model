# ⚙️ FourTwenty • The Catalyst

**Orbit:** Growth & Experience System  
**Theme:** Experimentation & Transformation — test changes, measure lift, and keep flows moving forward.  

---

## About

- The Catalyst is the constellation’s **ticketing star**, designed to manage transformation flows across the architecture.  
- When the Architect initiates a new process flow, a **ticket** is created in The Catalyst.  
- The Catalyst monitors the lifecycle of this ticket, presenting KPIs in its dashboard and pulsing reminders if tickets stall without progress.  
- The Catalyst also serves as an **analysis engine** — over time, as it collects more ticket histories, it can deliver **scenario analysis** on open flows, helping Suitekeepers predict completion times and identify bottlenecks before they impact other stars.

## Core Functions

- **Ticket Creation:** Capture a new process flow as a `ticket.yml` entry.  
- **Lifecycle Monitoring:** Track ticket status through states (e.g., `open → in_progress → complete`).  
- **KPIs & Dashboards:** Present ticket metrics such as:  
  - Average time to completion  
  - Tickets by status (open, in_progress, blocked, complete)  
  - Longest outstanding tickets  
  - Flow throughput (tickets opened vs. closed per period)  
- **Pulses:**
  - Broadcast when a ticket has been inactive for too long.
  - Broadcast when a star has been inactive in its development for too long.
  - Broadcast when a star has completed a process.  
- **Scenario Analysis:**
  - Uses historical ticket data to forecast likely completion paths and risks.
  - Uses open source environmental data to help boost the star's ability to evaluate tickets.
