# 🔥 Catalyst Model  
_Modular Decision Engine for Strategic Ignition and Transformation_

The Catalyst Model is the activation node within the Orbiter–Anchor–Catalyst suite. It transforms filtered signals into momentum—triggering strategic shifts, unlocking new trajectories, and accelerating aligned change. Catalyst is designed for environments where clarity has been restored and transformation is ready to begin.

Unlike Orbiter’s detachment or Anchor’s grounding, Catalyst initiates movement. It amplifies signals, activates latent potential, and drives forward motion across modular systems. It is the spark that converts insight into impact.

## ⚙️ Core Functions

- **Signal Amplification**  
  Elevates filtered inputs into actionable momentum.

- **Trajectory Ignition**  
  Triggers new strategic paths, workflows, or model states.

- **Transformation Logic**  
  Executes change protocols across dynamic environments.

## 🔄 Lifecycle Logic

Catalyst operates in three ignition phases:

1. **Signal Amplification**  
   Elevates filtered signals from Anchor into momentum-ready inputs.

2. **Trajectory Ignition**  
   Activates new paths, workflows, or model states.

3. **Transformation Execution**  
   Applies change logic across modular systems.

## 🧭 Suite Context

Catalyst completes the Orbiter–Anchor–Catalyst suite:

- **Orbiter** – Simulates strategic detachment and drift  
- **Anchor** – Restores alignment and filters signals  
- **Catalyst** – Converts clarity into transformation

Together, they form a cyclical system for strategic evolution, recalibration, and activation.
